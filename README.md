## Introduction
Image classification has a wide range of researched techniques and approaches which have been applied to a variety of problems. Our project is interested in exploring the application of this technology to classifying Pokémon, the namesake fictional creatures in Nintendo’s popular game series. Existing techniques for classifying animals do exist, and it would be interesting to apply this technology to Pokémon types, which can be considered a loose analog for animal taxonomical groups (family, phylum, etc.).

## Problem Definition
The classification of Pokémon by types can be considered to be an interesting toy problem of the real life problem of animal image classification. Advantages of working with pokemon are that they are easily observable and replicable, and with the introduction of more recent entries into the Pokémon game franchise, it is feasible to build a very robust of pokemon images not just from their official art, but from 3d models at various angles as well. Working on this classification problem will also likely have the unintended but interesting consequence of offering insight into how Pokémon designers generate new ideas (what features, colors, etc. do they seem to associate with different types).
